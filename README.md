# python3_assignments

The following repository holds python3 assignments done for the University of Michigan Ann Arbour ***Python3 Programming Coursera Specialization**. While I have had experience with python since my senior year in college, and I work with python extensively at my job; I have always wanted to better my core understandings of the languague. This repository is a reflection of that as I follow this specialization.

The respository devides itself in Course Folders under an Assignments Folder

Course 1
Course 2
Course 3
Within Each Course Folder you can fin Final Projects and weekly assignments for each course section.

There are 5 courses to this specialization, each section lasting around a month and a half. At the end of each specialization section, which is compromised of several hours of lectures and practices, there is a project assignment. I will be posting this final project assignments, and the individual weekly tasks, to this repository. Some courses might only have the final projects. I will be posting these final project assignments, and not the individual weekly tasks, to this repository.

The purpose of this repository is to not only document my progress, but also to allow anyone interested in understanding my python3 progress (outside of work, since most of my projects, repositories, and packages are in made for a private institution), to take a look. I would say most of this code is very basic in comparison to what I do everyday, but I think it is necessary; and works as a foundation for all future documentaiton of my programming experience.

My work also focuses very much on Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics, and these repositories mostly focus on other topics, which hopelly gives anyone interested a wider view of my abilities. I will also use this as an opportunity to explore other python capabilities and projects.
